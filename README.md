### 🔒 Privacy & Data Access

- Petrichor is sandboxed and notarized by Apple.
- It has two permissions on macOS as follows;
  - **Read-write access**
    - To read and write into user-selected files and folders,
      write access is only used for exporting M3U playlist files.
  - **Network access**
    - To check for and install app updates.
    - Fetch artist images and bios from online sources (disabled by default)
    - Download track lyrics from the internet (disabled by default)
    - Last.fm scrobbling (disabled by default)
        - When enabled, app may ask to store your Last.fm session information in macOS Keychain, if you choose to allow it, macOS will ask for your user account password to store the information in Keychain.
        - App **does not** store your Last.fm username or password, you still have to provide it on Last.fm website that opens in browser during configuration, once done, app only receives a session key to scrobble track playbacks with your account.
    - Reporting issues from within the app (user opt-in only)
        - Users can report a problem from within the app by going to Menu > Help > Report a Problem..., this opens a form where user is asked to fill out a few details, including detailed app diagnostics, along with app's log file.
        - This is optional feature and uses network only when user manually initiates this action and sends the information over the internet to app's backend server securely.
- It doesn't (and never will) have any analytics on how you use the app.
- It never changes your audio files or folder structure in any way.
- Your library data remains offline always.

## 🏗️ Development

### Motivation

I have a large collection of music files that I’ve gathered over the years, and I missed having a good offline
music player on macOS. I've used several free and paid options but I missed the simplicity and features commonly
found in streaming apps; so I built Petrichor to scratch that itch and learn Swift and macOS app development
along the way!

### Implementation Overview

- Built with Swift and SwiftUI with some parts in AppKit for the best macOS integration.
- Once folders containing music files are added, the app scans them, extracts required metadata, and populates the SQLite database.
- The app does **not** alter your music files, it only reads from the directories you add.
- Tracks searching is handled by [SQLite FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html).
- Playback is handled by [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/) and third-party audio decoders.

### Credits

Petrichor wouldn't be possible without following open source projects!

- [GRDB.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/)
- [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle)

### Development Setup

- Make sure you’re running macOS 14 or later.
- Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
- Clone the repository and open `Petrichor.xcodeproj`

#### Build & Release

You can build your own `.dmg` installer using the [`build-installer.sh`](Scripts/build-installer.sh) script,
although it requires you to have a paid Apple Developer account to notarize the compiled binary and installer,
you can use `--bypass-notary` option if you don't want to notarize. To use the script, make sure you have
following tools installed along with Xcode;

- [xcpretty](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty)
- [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg)
